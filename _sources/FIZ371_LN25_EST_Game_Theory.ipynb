    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Game theory deals with possible outcomes and determining strategies while taking into account the opponents' reactions. By game, we imply any conflict where there is a competition. The game can be cooperative/non-cooperative; constant sum, zero sum or non-zero sum; symmetryic or asymmetric. It has many forms and extends from a chess game to a diplomatic decision that can lead to a world war. In the end, game theory is used to analyze a given conundrum/situation and to come up with the decision that will yield the maximum gain.\n",
    "\n",
    "John Nash was a very influential mathematician who developed an analytical approach to this vast field under the name \"game theory\" for which he received the Nobel prize for Economics in 1994.\n",

    "* Wanda going to the opera while Manny goes to the football\n",

    "Wanda and Manny are two good friends, they really love spending time together. Wanda isn't a big fan of football, she prefers opera. Manny enjoys watching football matches alas not so enthusiastic about opera. But, as they enjoy being with each other, they certainly prefer attending to their least favorite activity together than watching their favorite activity by themselves (e.g., even though, when alone, Wanda prefers watching an opera than watching a football match, she'll definitely prefer watching a football match with Manny than watching an opera alone by herself). \n",

    "The probability that each of them will be at a specific event is naturally ruled by the expected pay-off (they are trying to maximize the joy they will receive). We will be using $M_F$, $M_O$, $W_F$ and $W_O$ to represent the probability that Manny will go to the football match($M_F$), opera($M_O$); Wanda going to the football($W_F$) or opera($W_O$), respectively. Then, taking into account of the pay-offs, we can formulate:\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's break-down the factors: the 1 before $W_O$ in the numerator is the pay-off for Manny should he goes to the football game when Wanda has gone to the opera and 3 before the $W_F$ is the joy he gets when he goes to the football game and finds out that Wanda is also there!\n",
    "\n",
    "The denominator is the total pay-off sum of all the possibilities for Manny (_mathematically speaking_, it's actually the normalizing constant so we can treat $M_F$ as a probability).\n",
    "\n",
    "$$M_F=\\frac{W_O + 3W_F}{3W_O + 3W_F}=\\frac{W_O + 3W_F}{3\\underbrace{\\left(W_O + W_F\\right)}_{W_O + W_F=1}}=\\frac{1}{3}(W_O + 3W_F) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we used the fact that $W_O + W_F=1$ as $W_O$ is the probability that Wanda will go to the opera and $W_F$ is the probability that she'll go to the football match and as there are no other options, so the sum of these two probabilities must be equal to 1."

    "# Nash Equilibrium\n",
    "When each player knows about the choice of the others and yet won't change their choice (i.e., they are happy with their current choice) then it is said that the game is in a Nash equilibrium, which is the most optimal solution sought. For small and simple systems, there is a simple and systematical way to find the Nash equilibrium points (there can be more than one, as we'll see). Also, Nash has proved (in his Nobel awarded work... of [2 pages](https://www.pnas.org/content/36/1/48)!) that in a complicated and within many yet finite strategies, there is always at least one Nash equilibrium (assuming a special condition that allows mixed strategies). Also, after many iterated tries (playing the same game over and over), the system is expected to reach an equilibrium however, in a [recent research, it has been shown to be not de-facto, with exceptions](https://www.quantamagazine.org/in-game-theory-no-clear-path-to-equilibrium-20170718/).\n",
    "\n",
    "So, for simple systems such as the ones we have considered, where a 2 dimensional pay-off table is sufficient, we consider each player's stance from the other's possible choice. \n",
    "\n",
    "In a 2 player setup, start from one of the cells:\n",
    "* Take the column player's point of view. For each of the cells in that row, compare the immediate neighbours (to the left and right) and point it towards the one with the better yield (higher pay-off). If the current cell is higher yielding, then direct the arrows towards that.\n",
    "* Once you finish the comparison of the rows, then take on the role of the row player and repeat the procedure, this time considering the neighbours above and below.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prisoner's Dilemma\n",

    "Here, Alice is the column player (because it can make its choice between $A_s$ (above) and $A_d$ (below)) and Bob is the row player (as it chooses between $B_s$ (left) and $B_d$ (right))\n",
    "\n",
    "First we take on Alice's role and let's start from the top left cell (2,2). Alice can choose to stay here (remain silent) or go to the cell below (defect). In this situation (where Bob is remaining silent) if she stays, she gains \"2\" but if she defects, her gain is \"3\" so she will choose to defect (in basic Game Theory, moral or irrational choices are excluded and maximum yield is the ultimate object). So, our chart will be marked as:\n",

    "|$A_{d}$|3,0|1,1\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we move on to Bob's other possible outcome scenario (him defecting). In this case, once again defecting is the better option for Alice (\"0\" $\\rightarrow$ \"1\"), so we mark the 2nd column downwards as well, pointing to the row where Alice defects:\n",

    "Having covered all possibilities for Alice, we now take the role of Bob: his decisions allows movement along the rows. So if he's presented with a situation where Alice is silent, he maximizes his gain by defecting (\"2\" $\\rightarrow$ \"3\") and if Alice is defecting, his choice will also be defecting (\"0\" $\\rightarrow$ \"1\"), so, the pay-off table will be marked as:\n",

    "\n",
    "From the graph above, we can see that, no matter where we start, we are forced to move along the arrows and we end up at the bottom-right cell where Alice and Bob both defect. This is the Nash equilibrium point. \n",
    "\n",
    "From its definition, Nash equilibrium is the state where, given that the other player's choice is revealed, the player won't change their own choice. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the case that Alice is thinking of remaining silent but then she learns that Bob has defected: in that case, she'll also defect. The same goes for Bob -- for any of Alice's possible choices, himself defecting is the most rewarding, so he will always defect. Both of them defecting is the **only** case where upon learning other's intentions, they will not change their decision."
