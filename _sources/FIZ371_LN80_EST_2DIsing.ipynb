    "The Ising model is the modelling of a network with nodes interacting with each other with respect to some order. Initially developed by Ernst Ising in 1925 to model the phase transition in 1D in order to observe critical variables in action, alas Ising didn't manage to encounter any phase transition and gave up the model, until much later. The model was analytically solved by Lars Onsager in 1944. The 3D version has not yet been solved although there are a couple of claims."

    "## Relevance of Ising models\n",
    "As for the relevance and importance of Ising models, I'm quoting directly from our textbook, [MacKay's \"Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms\"](http://www.inference.org.uk/mackay/itprnn/book.html):\n",
    "\n",
    "Ising models are relevant for three reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ising models are important first as models of magnetic systems that have a phase transition. The theory of universality in statistical physics shows that all systems with the same dimension (here, two), and the same symmetries, have equivalent critical properties, i.e., the scaling laws shown by their phase transitions are identical. So by studying Ising models we can find out not only about magnetic phase transitions but also about phase transitions in many other systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, if we generalize the energy function to\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E(\\vec{x};\\vec{J},\\vec{h}) =-\\left[\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{m,n}{J_{mn}x_m x_n}+\\sum_n{h_n x_n}\\right]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the couplings $J_{mn}$ and applied fields $h_n$ are not constant, we obtain a family of models known as 'spin glasses' to physicists, and as 'Hopfield networks' or 'Boltzmann machines' to the neural network community. In some of these models, all spins are declared to be neighbours of each other, in which case physicists call the system an \"infinite-range\" spin glass, and networks call it a \"fully connected\" network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third, the Ising model is also useful as a statistical model on its own right."

    "# Ferromagnetic Materials\n",
    "A ferromagnetic material is a material whose atomic spins align with the applied external magnetic field and even at the lack of an external field, its atoms also tend to align their magnetic moments with that of their neighbours resulting in spin domains:\n",
    "\n",
    "![NdFeB-Domains.jpg](images/NdFeB-Domains.jpg)\n",
    "[Source: Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_domain)\n",
    "\n",
    "The magnetic contribution to the energy comes from the following interaction in the Hamiltonian:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E(\\vec{x};J,H) =-\\left[\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{m,n}{J_{mn}x_m x_n}+\\sum_n{Hx_n}\\right]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $\\vec{x}$ is the spin configuration of the sites; $x_i$ is the spin of the <i>i</i>th site (-1 for \"down\" and +1 for \"up\"); $J_{mn}$ is the coupling coefficient between the $m$ and $n$ sites and $H$ is the applied external field, if there is any.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can define the interaction depth of the spins via the coupling coefficient $J_{mn}$: for example, the coefficient can be 5 for the *nearest neighbours*, 3 for the *next nearest neighbours* and 0 for the rest of the atoms making them irrelevant to the site at hand. J's sign indicates the ferromagnetic/antiferromagnetic tendency, with $J>0$ the spins tend to align in the same direction whereas negative $J$ drives the antiferromagnetic behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity, we will assume $J_{mn} = J$ if $m$ and $n$ are neighbours and $J_{mn} = 0$ otherwise, so the only manipulation to the spins will be due to the neighbours.\n",
    "\n",

    "So, from the previous section, as we have the probability equation, we can use the partition function $Z$ to first to calculate the free energy and then the entropy of our system. However, there is a very bit tiny problem with the calculation of the partition function. \n",
    "\n",
    "Even with a very small system of $10\\times10$ grid, where each site can have a sping value of $\\pm1$, we will have $2^{100}$ possible configurations ($\\{\\vec x\\}$), which will take more than the age of the universe to calculate on a supercomputer as we know it.\n",
    "\n",
